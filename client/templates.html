        This page is for testing the Agora forum application. Please keep in
        mind that this application is in it's infancy,and as such likely has very
        poor security. Do not use a password you are using anywhere else, as
        it may very well be stolen, and do not post anything you are not
        prepared to see deleted, as database clears will likely be common for
        the foreseeable future. If you wish to report an issue or see what
        future developements are planned, please do so
        <a href="https://gitlab.com/Agora-Project/agora-meteor/issues">here</a>.

        <h2 align="center">What is Agora?</h2>

        Agora is a new kind of internet forum designed to allow large numbers of
        people to discuss complicated topics and come to meaningful conclusions.
        It does this by changing the structure of the conversation - instead of
        a linear thread of replies, a post can have any number of other posts in
        response to it. Thus, discussions can diverge into different threads for
        all the various details. In a linear thread, this all has to happen in
        the same place.

        <h3 align="center">Instructions for Use</h3>

        <p></p>The forum displays posts in a force directed graph. Click and
        drag or use arrow keys to pan about the graph, and use the mouse wheel or zoom bar to zoom
        in and out. Once you've zoomed in far enough, you can reply to a post by
        clicking the reply buttons and then filling out the reply
        box that appears at the bottom of the screen.

        <h4 align="center">Learn more and contribute</h4>

        <p></p>You can see the github projects for the forum and the test site
        containing it <a href="https://gitlab.com/Agora-Project/agora-meteor">

        <a href="https://gitlab.com/Agora-Project/agora-meteor-basic">here</a>
        (Test site using said forum).

        If you wish to submit an bug report or a suggestion for improvement, please
        place an issue on one of the repositories above.

        Finally, if you wish to contribute, there are several different ways.
        First and foremost, simply using the forum, reporting bugs, and making
        suggestions for how it might be improved is quite helpful, and is what I
        need the most right now. Helping hunt down bugs or implement new
        features is alos much appreciated, if you wish to do this please contact
        me and we can work things out. And, last but not least, if you wish to
        contribute financially, I have a

        <h2 align="center">About Me</h2>

        My name is Gregory Sartucci and I am very concerned for the future. I
        don't think our civilization is prepared to face the challenges ahead of it,
        as we are today. In order to deal with climate change, A.I., and other
        problems ahead of us, I think we need better methods to communicate and
        discuss complicated ideas on a mass scale. That is why I am working on this project.
